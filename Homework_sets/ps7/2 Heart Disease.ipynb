    "\n",
    "That completes the label swap. You could package this code into a function that you call repeatedly during 10,000 simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generating list indices:** To randomly pick subjects from the list of pooled data, first create a list of *indices* representing the rows. (Just as in `simulate_monty_10`, you randomly picked from door indices, rather picking from the list of actual prizes.) To get indices from a list, you can use `enumerate()` in a `for` loop, as in the Monty Hall code. If you *just* want indices though, here's a one-liner that does it:\n",

In the task above, you used the lists in `pooled_subjects` to create new lists, without copying them first. This means that `pooled_subjects` and `random_diet` (and `random_control`) are pointing to the same lists. If you change subject data in one list, it would also change in the other one.\n",
