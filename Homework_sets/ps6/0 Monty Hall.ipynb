But it can't be modified (with `append`, `remove` and so forth) like a real list. To get a true python list from a range, just ask to convert it to a list: `list(range(6))`.

Try `assert len(other_doors) == 4` (assuming that you used the `other_doors` variable to store the results of `simulate_monty_6`) to make sure that your helper functions are doing the right thing. "
