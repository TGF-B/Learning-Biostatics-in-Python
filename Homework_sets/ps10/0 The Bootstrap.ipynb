                "The bootstrap is an approach to generating new samples from the \"true\" distribution. There's only one **real** way to get new samples from the actual true distribution, and that's to run your experiment again. The bootstrap offers a different idea: we assume that our existing sample is representative of the \"true\" distribution, so to approximate new samples from the \"true\" distribution, we can repeatedly draw new samples from our existing sample. This process of repeatedly drawing new samples is called \"resampling\" or \"bootstrapping\".\n",
                "\n",
                "Technically, what the bootstrap assumes is that the relationship between the \"true\" distribution and our sample is approximately the same as the relationship between our sample and the bootstrap (re-)samples that we draw from it. We will explore this idea more in the next lecture. For now, however, let's just get comfortable with resampling.\n",

                "Below, a list of lifespans is provided, giving the length of the lives of 96 *C. elegans* (in days). Write a function called `resample_means` that will generate a specified number of resamples of the a given dataset, and for each resample, calculate the mean of that resample. As is standard for bootstrapping, each resampled dataset should be the same size as the original dataset. The function should return a list containing the mean value for each resampled dataset.\n",
                "\n",
                "The most straightforward way to perform the actual resampling is with the `choices` function from the `random` module. (Try importing `random` and then type `random.choices?` to see the documentation. In short, `choices` performs sampling *with replacement* which is exactly what is needed here. Note that `random.sample` is the equivalent function for sampling *without replacement*, but you really don't want to use that here!) \n",
